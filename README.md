# Meet

### About The Project

Meet is a progressive web application (PWA) with React using a
test-driven development (TDD) technique.
The application provides a list of Calendar events fetched from the Google Calendar API. Users can authenticate with their Google account to get access to the Application. 
The application uses AWS Lambda serverless functions and works both online and offline

### User stories

- As a user, I should be able to filter events by city and see the list of events in that city.
- As a user, I should be able to show/hide event details about an event.
- As a user, I should be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the app.
- As a user, I would like to be able to use the app offline so that I can see the events I viewed the last time I was online.
- As a user, I would like to be able to add the app shortcut to my home screen
- As a user, I would like to be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city
